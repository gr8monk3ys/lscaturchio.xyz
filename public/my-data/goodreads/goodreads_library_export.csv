Through this simple yet profound tale, Steinbeck reminds us of the beauty and tragedy in the aspirations we hold onto, even when the odds are stacked against us. At its core, it’s the delicate nature of human connection and the elusive promise of the American Dream that binds George and Lennie, making their story feel deeply human and heartbreakingly real.",,,1,0

Covey’s approach isn’t just about productivity but also building character and aligning actions with values. The habits themselves are a simple roadmap for meaningful collaboration. Be Proactive encourages us to take ownership of our choices rather than reacting to circumstances. Begin with the End in Mind helps us define as well as align our actions with long-term goals. Put First Things First emphasizes prioritizing what truly matters so that you could essentially train your executive functioning.  Turning outward, Think Win-Win fosters mutual respect and benefit in relationships, while Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood challenges us to listen empathetically before asserting our perspectives. Synergize is the celebration of teamwork and the creative potential of diverse perspectives and backgrounds, and finally, Sharpen the Saw reminds us to continually renew ourselves: physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Each of the following habits build upon each other causing somewhat of a snowball effect on one's quality of life (ideally). The insights I find are timeless, and while the concepts take effort to implement and work on every day, overall this is informative for how to live a fulfilled life.",,,1,0

It’s a testament to a certain type of mentality. For example, if we replaced the children from England with a group of stranded kids from Nepal, the outcome would be entirely different. Why is that? Because Nepal is an example of a country that derives happiness from community, making it far easier for individuals to assimilate and work together.  <br/><br/>This isn’t to say, 'Ooh, capitalism bad'no, because capitalism can bring about wonders that help most if done properly and within reason. What I am suggesting is that individualism should not be celebrated as heavily as it is in today’s world. The genius of this story lies in its ability to make the descent into chaos feel both inevitable and terrifyingly familiar for anyone with this mentality, succumbing without rules on a deserted island.<br/><br/>I implore you, including myself to do things because they help others.
