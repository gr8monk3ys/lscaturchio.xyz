# Bioregionalism: Thinking Like a Watershed

## Arbitrary Lines

Look at a political map of the United States. See those straight lines? The ones that slice through the Great Plains, carve up the Mountain West, divide the desert Southwest into neat rectangles?

Those lines mean nothing.

They don't follow rivers. They don't follow mountain ranges. They don't follow watersheds or ecosystems or any natural feature whatsoever. They're artifacts of land surveys, political compromises, and historical accidents. They were drawn by people in distant rooms using rulers on maps, dividing territory they'd never seen.

And yet these meaningless lines determine everything. They determine who governs what water. They determine environmental regulations, agricultural policies, resource extraction rules. They create jurisdictions that have no relationship to the ecological systems they supposedly manage.

This is insane.

## What Bioregionalism Means

Bioregionalism proposes a simple idea: political boundaries should follow ecological ones.

Instead of organizing governance around historical accidents and survey coordinates, organize it around watersheds, ecosystems, and natural regions. Let the lines on the map reflect the actual functioning of the landscape.

This isn't just an aesthetic preference. It's a practical argument about how to actually manage natural systems.

Water doesn't respect state lines. A river basin is a single integrated system; what happens upstream affects everything downstream. But when that basin is divided among multiple jurisdictions, each with different laws and priorities, coordinated management becomes nearly impossible.

The same applies to forests, fisheries, wildlife populations, air quality, and every other ecological system that humans depend on. Nature doesn't care about political boundaries. Neither should we.

## Thinking Like a Watershed

A watershed is everything that drains into a particular body of water. It's defined by topography, by where rainfall flows. Every point on land is part of some watershed, connected by gravity and hydrology to larger systems.

Watersheds are natural units of ecological organization. What happens anywhere in a watershed affects the whole system. Pollution upstream becomes contamination downstream. Deforestation in headwaters means flooding and erosion below. Groundwater pumping here depletes aquifers there.

Thinking like a watershed means understanding these connections. It means recognizing that actions have consequences beyond their immediate location. It means seeing the landscape as an integrated system rather than a collection of separate parcels.

This kind of thinking is obvious to anyone who actually works with land and water. Farmers understand it. Fishers understand it. Indigenous peoples, who organized their territories around ecological realities long before colonial surveyors showed up, understood it.

Only modern political systems pretend that arbitrary lines on maps are more real than the landscapes they divide.

## The Political Argument

Bioregionalism isn't just about ecology. It's about democracy.

When political boundaries don't match ecological realities, democratic decision-making about environmental issues becomes impossible. The people affected by decisions don't get to participate in making them. The consequences of actions fall on people in different jurisdictions who have no voice in the process.

Consider a river that flows through multiple states. Decisions made by upstream states (about pollution limits, water withdrawals, land use) determine what downstream states receive. But downstream residents have no representation in upstream governments. They're affected by decisions they can't influence.

This is a democratic failure. And it happens constantly, invisibly, everywhere political boundaries cross ecological ones.

Bioregional governance would align democratic authority with ecological impact. The people affected by decisions about a watershed would be the people making those decisions. Representation would match reality.

## The Practical Challenges

Redrawing political boundaries is hard. Obviously. States aren't going to voluntarily dissolve. Counties aren't going to merge because some ecologist says they should. The existing political system has enormous inertia.

But bioregionalism doesn't require abolishing existing jurisdictions (though that would be nice). It can work through coordination, cooperation, and the creation of new governing bodies that overlay existing ones.

This already happens, imperfectly. Interstate compacts manage some river basins. Regional authorities coordinate across jurisdictions. Various forms of collaborative governance bring together stakeholders from different political units to address shared ecological challenges.

These arrangements are inadequate: too weak, too underfunded, too subject to political interference. But they demonstrate that trans-boundary ecological governance is possible. The question is whether we're willing to make it effective.

## Place-Based Identity

Bioregionalism also proposes a different way of thinking about identity and belonging.

Instead of identifying with arbitrary political units (states, nations) identify with the places you actually inhabit. Know your watershed. Know what mountains define your horizon. Know what species share your ecosystem. Know where your water comes from and where your waste goes.

This kind of place-based knowledge was universal among humans for most of history. People knew their landscapes intimately because their survival depended on it. They understood seasonal patterns, ecological relationships, the carrying capacity of their environments.

Modern life has severed this connection. Most people have no idea what watershed they live in. They don't know what direction their water flows. They don't know what grew in their region before agriculture and development transformed it.

Bioregionalism asks us to rebuild this knowledge. Not as nostalgia, but as practical wisdom necessary for living sustainably in specific places.

## Beyond Nation-States

The bioregional critique extends beyond internal boundaries to the nation-state system itself.

Nations are historical accidents. Their borders were drawn by wars, treaties, colonial impositions, and political compromises. They have no more ecological validity than the straight lines crossing the American West.

And yet nations claim absolute sovereignty over the territories within their borders. They can do whatever they want to their portion of shared ecosystems. International environmental agreements are voluntary and weakly enforced.

The results are predictable. Transboundary ecosystems get destroyed because no one has authority to protect them. Climate change accelerates because no institution can compel nations to reduce emissions. Oceans, atmosphere, and migrating species fall through the cracks of a governance system designed for static territories.

Effective environmental governance requires institutions that match the scale of ecological systems. For global systems like climate, that means global governance. For regional systems like river basins, that means regional governance. The nation-state is the wrong unit for almost every ecological challenge.

## The Vision

Imagine a world where political boundaries followed watersheds. Where governance operated at ecological scales. Where the people responsible for managing a forest were the people who lived in that forest. Where decisions about water were made by everyone in the watershed.

This world would still have conflicts. People would still disagree about land use and resource extraction and environmental protection. But the conflicts would be among people with shared stakes in shared places, rather than between distant authorities with no connection to the landscapes they govern.

Bioregionalism won't solve every problem. It's not a utopia. It's a different way of drawing lines on maps, one that reflects ecological reality rather than historical accident.

The current system is failing. It's failing ecologically: species extinctions, ecosystem collapse, climate catastrophe. It's failing democratically: decisions made by people unaccountable to those affected. It's failing practically: governance structures incapable of addressing the challenges they face.

Maybe it's time to think differently. To think like a watershed. To recognize that the lines on our maps are just lines, and we can draw them differently.

The landscape doesn't care about our boundaries. Perhaps we should care about the landscape.
