## The Illusion of Neutrality

You already have a mythology. You already have a story that explains where you came from, what you're supposed to do, and what happens when you die. Maybe you don't call it mythology. Maybe you call it "just the way things are" or "being realistic" or "science."

But it's mythology all the same.

The rationalist who scoffs at religious narratives has their own creation story (the Big Bang), their own metaphysics (materialism), their own eschatology (heat death, or perhaps technological transcendence), and their own ethics (usually some variant of utilitarian calculation). These aren't empirical discoveries. They're frameworks for organizing experience into meaning.

This isn't a criticism. It's just the human condition. We can't operate without these frameworks. The brain can't process raw experience — it needs categories, narratives, purposes. Strip those away and you don't get enlightened rationality. You get psychological collapse.

## The Meaning-Seeking Animal

Evolution produced a creature that asks "why?"

This was probably adaptive. The ability to construct causal narratives — this berry made me sick, that animal attacks when threatened, these clouds mean rain — conferred survival advantages. Pattern recognition and story construction overlap substantially in the brain. We're built to find meaning even where none exists (hence conspiracy theories, superstitions, and seeing faces in random noise).

But the same capacity that helps us predict the weather makes us need cosmic explanation. We can't just exist. We need a reason for existing. The brain that asks "why did the branch fall?" inevitably asks "why am I here?"

And there's no way to turn this off. You can refuse to consciously construct meaning, but your unconscious will do it anyway. You'll find yourself acting as if life has purpose even while professing that it doesn't. The professed nihilist still gets out of bed, still makes choices, still feels betrayed by injustice. Their behavior reveals a meaning structure their words deny.

## The Vacuum Gets Filled

When traditional religious meaning structures collapse — as they have across much of the developed world — the need for meaning doesn't disappear. It finds other outlets.

Politics becomes religion. Economic theory becomes religion. Nationalism becomes religion. Self-optimization becomes religion. Environmental catastrophism becomes religion. Not metaphorically — structurally. These frameworks provide the same psychological services: explanation of suffering, hope for redemption, community of believers, rituals of belonging, villains to oppose, purpose to pursue.

And because they're not recognized as religious, they often become more extreme. Traditional religions have centuries of theological development, of learning how to moderate claims, of distinguishing metaphor from literalism. The new secular religions have no such tradition. They're prey to every pathology of religious fundamentalism while lacking the self-awareness to recognize it.

A political ideology held religiously becomes fanatical. An economic theory held religiously becomes dogma. A diet held religiously becomes disordered eating dressed in self-improvement language. The religious impulse, denied legitimate expression, goes underground and emerges in distorted forms.

## The Psychological Research

This isn't just philosophical speculation. The empirical literature consistently shows that meaning-making is associated with psychological wellbeing.

People who report having meaning in their lives handle stress better, recover from trauma faster, show lower rates of depression and anxiety. The specific content of the meaning matters less than having it. Religious meaning works. So does secular purpose — career calling, family dedication, artistic mission. What doesn't work is having no meaning at all.

There's a reason addiction recovery programs emphasize higher powers. Not because supernatural beings exist (a separate question) but because humans need to locate themselves within larger narratives. The isolated individual pursuing individual pleasure is a recipe for despair. Connection to something beyond the self — something that gives structure and purpose — is psychologically necessary.

Depression is often described as meaninglessness. The experience of depression isn't primarily sadness — it's the collapse of purpose. Nothing matters. Nothing is worth doing. The future holds nothing of value. This is a meaning crisis dressed as a mood disorder. And while medications can help with the neurochemistry, lasting recovery usually requires reconstructing a sense of meaning.

## Which Mythology?

So if meaning isn't optional — if we're going to have a mythology whether we acknowledge it or not — the question becomes: which mythology?

Not all meaning structures are equal. Some make people miserable. Some produce terrible behavior. Some collapse under the weight of their own contradictions. The medieval peasant had plenty of meaning, but that meaning trapped them in rigid hierarchies and justified horrific cruelty. Meaning isn't automatically good.

There are criteria for evaluating mythologies. Does this framework correspond reasonably well to observable reality? Does it produce flourishing for its adherents? Does it encourage virtue or vice? Does it make demands that are achievable? Does it provide genuine community or just in-group tribalism? Does it handle suffering and death in ways that allow people to face them with dignity?

These questions matter more than whether the mythology is "true" in some naive empiricist sense. All mythologies are metaphorical at bottom. The universe doesn't literally have a purpose — but humans need to act as if it does. The choice isn't between mythology and no mythology. It's between better and worse mythologies.

## The Failure of Secular Substitutes

The Enlightenment promised that reason would replace religion, providing meaning without the supernatural baggage. This hasn't worked out.

Pure reason can't generate meaning. It can analyze relationships between propositions. It can optimize for given goals. But it can't supply the goals themselves. "Why should I continue living?" isn't a question logic can answer. Neither is "what makes life worth living?" These require value claims that reason can't produce from first principles.

So secular societies import meaning from elsewhere — usually from religious traditions they no longer acknowledge. Human rights, individual dignity, the moral equality of persons — none of these follow from materialism. They're borrowed from Christianity, smuggled in without attribution. The secular humanist standing on two thousand years of religious moral development while mocking religion is sawing off the branch they're sitting on.

And the borrowed capital is running out. Each generation receives less of the implicit meaning structure. The transmission mechanism — religious education, communal ritual, shared sacred text — has been dismantled. What replaces it? Consumption? Career? The thin gruel of secular psychology can't nourish like the feast of religious tradition.

## Building Meaning Consciously

Most people throughout history inherited their meaning structures. They were born into communities with established narratives, rituals, and purposes. Meaning was a given, not a choice.

That's less and less true. Many people now find themselves meaning-orphans — cut off from the traditions that shaped their ancestors, without obvious alternatives. They have to construct meaning deliberately.

This is both opportunity and burden. The opportunity: freedom to select meaning structures that actually fit, rather than being stuck with whatever you inherited. The burden: the exhausting work of construction, the anxiety of choice, the absence of communal reinforcement.

Building meaning consciously requires engagement with the deep questions. What is a good life? What duties do I have to others? How should I face suffering and death? What, if anything, transcends my individual existence? These aren't questions with easy answers. They require reading, reflection, conversation, experimentation. They require taking seriously traditions that might seem alien or outdated. They require intellectual humility — the recognition that people throughout history were not idiots, and their answers to these questions deserve consideration.

## The Return to Practice

Meaning isn't primarily propositional. It's enacted.

You can have a coherent meaning framework that does nothing for you because you don't practice it. The philosophy on the shelf is worthless. What matters is the philosophy lived — the rituals performed, the community engaged, the principles applied.

This is where religious traditions have an advantage. They've developed technologies for embedding meaning in practice. Daily prayers, weekly gatherings, annual festivals, lifecycle rituals — these aren't just cultural decoration. They're delivery mechanisms for meaning. They take abstract beliefs and make them concrete, habitual, embodied.

Secular attempts to replace religion often fail because they focus on beliefs while ignoring practices. You can believe in human dignity without having any ritual that reinforces it. You can believe in community without gathering regularly. And beliefs without practices wither. They become abstractions rather than living realities.

## The Stakes

Meaning isn't a luxury. It's a necessity.

Without meaning, people don't just feel sad — they fall apart. They turn to addiction, to fanaticism, to despair. They become vulnerable to every demagogue offering purpose. They harm themselves and others.

The meaning crisis isn't separate from the mental health crisis, the addiction crisis, the political crisis. They're all symptoms of the same underlying problem: a civilization that has dismantled its meaning structures without building adequate replacements.

The question isn't whether you'll have a mythology. You already do, whether you recognize it or not. The question is whether you'll examine it, refine it, practice it consciously — or let it operate by default, unexamined, potentially destructive.

Meaning isn't optional. But which meaning you live by — that's the choice you can't escape.
