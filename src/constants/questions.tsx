    question: "What is your typical project engagement process?",
    answer: "I start with a free 30-minute discovery call to understand your goals and challenges. From there, I provide a detailed scope document outlining deliverables, timeline, and pricing. Once aligned, we kick off with a deeper technical discovery phase, followed by iterative development with regular check-ins. I prioritize clear communication and transparency throughout.",
  },
  {
    question: "What industries have you worked with?",
    answer: "I have experience across fintech, healthcare, e-commerce, and developer tools. My focus areas include AI/ML systems, data pipelines, and full-stack web applications. Whether you need a RAG-powered chatbot, a data analytics dashboard, or a custom automation solution, I can adapt to your domain.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle pricing and estimates?",
    answer: "I offer both project-based and hourly pricing depending on the scope. For well-defined projects, I provide fixed-price quotes with clear milestones. For exploratory or ongoing work, I bill hourly with detailed time tracking. I always discuss budget constraints upfront to find an approach that works for both of us.",
  },
  {
    question: "What deliverables can clients expect?",
    answer: "Depending on the project, deliverables typically include production-ready code, technical documentation, deployment guides, and knowledge transfer sessions. For data science projects, you will also receive model performance reports, data quality assessments, and recommendations for ongoing maintenance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle data confidentiality and NDAs?",
    answer: "I take data security seriously. I am happy to sign NDAs before any sensitive information is shared. All client data is handled according to best practices - encrypted in transit and at rest, with access strictly limited. I can also work within your existing security protocols if required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between one-time consulting and ongoing support?",
    answer: "One-time consulting is ideal for specific projects like building a proof-of-concept, auditing existing systems, or solving a particular technical challenge. Ongoing support includes regular maintenance, feature development, and strategic advisory. Many clients start with a one-time project and transition to ongoing support as their needs evolve.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with teams or just individuals?",
    answer: "Both. I work directly with founders and solo entrepreneurs, but I also collaborate with existing engineering teams. For team engagements, I can serve as a technical advisor, help with code reviews, or work as an embedded contributor. I adapt my communication style and workflow to fit your team structure.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your availability and typical response time?",
    answer: "I am based in Pasadena, CA (Pacific Time) and typically work Monday through Friday. For active projects, I respond to messages within 24 hours and am available for scheduled calls during business hours. For urgent matters, we can discuss priority support arrangements.",
