## Your Body Already Knows

Every winter, you want to sleep more. You crave heavier foods. Your energy dips. You feel like curling up somewhere warm rather than going out.

Every spring, something shifts. You want to move. Clean things. Start things. Energy returns without effort.

This isn't a bug. It's how humans are supposed to work.

But modern life tells you to ignore it. Same wake-up time year-round. Same expectations. Same schedule whether it's blazing July or dark December. The fluorescent lights don't change with the seasons, so why should you?

## The Industrial Override

Seasonal variation was a problem for capitalism. Factories can't sit idle for months. Supply chains need predictability. Workers who slow down in winter and accelerate in spring create scheduling headaches.

So we engineered seasonality out. Electric lighting extended the workday regardless of sunset. Climate control made indoor environments identical year-round. The office in January feels exactly like the office in August, on purpose.

And we adapted. Sort of.

Our bodies still run on circadian rhythms tied to light exposure. Melatonin production still shifts with day length. Hormone levels still fluctuate seasonally. The biology didn't get the memo about the industrial revolution.

The result is a constant low-grade war between what your body wants and what society demands.

## The Exhaustion Epidemic

Why do people get sick more in winter? The standard answer involves viruses spreading in close quarters. True enough. But there's something else: chronic circadian disruption plus sustained stress from fighting your body's natural downshift equals weakened immune function.

Winter is when the body wants to rest and repair. Instead, we demand it perform at summer levels. We pump ourselves full of caffeine. We blast artificial light until midnight. We feel guilty about wanting to sleep nine hours when it's dark at five p.m.

Then we're shocked when we crash.

## What Seasonal Living Actually Means

Let's be clear: nobody's suggesting we return to subsistence farming and die of smallpox. This isn't about romanticizing pre-modern life or pretending electricity was a mistake.

Seasonal living means acknowledging biological reality within modern constraints. It means working with your body instead of against it. Concretely:

**Winter**: Expect less output. Sleep more. Schedule fewer social obligations. Focus on completion and reflection rather than new initiatives. Eat warming, substantial foods. Don't fight the darkness; use it for rest.

**Spring**: Ride the rising energy. Start projects. Clean and declutter. Increase physical activity gradually. Let yourself feel the restlessness and channel it.

**Summer**: This is peak external energy time. Fill the schedule. Be social. Tackle demanding projects. Take advantage of long daylight. But also recognize when you're overextending.

**Autumn**: Begin winding down. Harvest what you started in spring. Finish things. Build reserves (financial, social, physical) for winter. Let go of what's not working.

None of this requires quitting your job or moving to a commune. It's about adjustments at the margin. Going to bed earlier in December. Taking on fewer commitments in January. Scheduling the ambitious project launch for April instead of February.

## The Counter-Arguments

"But I live somewhere without real seasons."

Even in temperate climates, day length changes significantly. Your body notices even if you don't consciously. And many "seasonless" places still have wet/dry cycles or subtle temperature shifts that affect biology.

"My job doesn't allow seasonal variation."

Fair. Most jobs don't. But you control your non-work time. Sleep schedule. Social commitments. Weekends. Vacations. There's more flexibility than you think, even within rigid employment.

"This sounds like an excuse for laziness."

This is the productivity cult talking. The assumption that any accommodation of human limitation is mere excuse-making. But consider: working with your biology instead of against it might actually increase total output over a year, even if winter months are slower. Sustainable beats unsustainable.

"I don't feel seasonal variation personally."

Spend more time outside. Most people who say this are indoors in climate-controlled environments so much they've genuinely lost touch with the rhythms. A few weeks of morning sun exposure and evening darkness tends to resensitize the system.

## The Light Problem

Artificial lighting is the biggest disruptor. We flood our evenings with blue-spectrum light from screens and LEDs, the exact wavelengths that suppress melatonin and tell our brains it's midday. Then we wonder why we can't sleep.

In winter especially, this creates a bizarre situation: the body expects darkness to signal rest, but it never comes. The biological night gets pushed later and later. Morning arrives (biologically speaking) while it's still dark outside and the alarm is demanding you get up for work.

Chronic circadian misalignment. Every winter. For years.

The fix isn't complicated. Reduce bright light after sunset, especially blue light. Get outside in morning light when possible. Let evening get darker. Your winter mood and energy will improve, not perfectly, but noticeably.

## Against Artificial Consistency

Industrial society values consistency. Same product, every time. Same performance, every day. Same output, month after month.

But biological systems aren't consistent. They're rhythmic. Oscillation is the natural pattern: up and down, active and rest, growth and dormancy. Forcing constant output requires constant inputs: caffeine, artificial light, willpower. It's expensive. It depletes.

What if instead of demanding consistency, we embraced rhythm? High-output periods funded by genuine rest. Sprints followed by recovery. Summers of intensity, winters of consolidation.

Athletes already know this. Training programs build in cycles of effort and recovery because that's what produces adaptation. Constant maximum effort just produces injury and burnout.

Why would knowledge work be different? It isn't. But we pretend it is.

## The Deeper Issue

Seasonal living challenges a fundamental assumption: that you should be able to override biology with willpower and technology. That the body is a machine to be managed rather than an organism to work with.

This assumption runs deep. It shows up in how we treat sleep (optional, reducible). How we treat food (fuel to be optimized). How we treat rest (unproductive time to be minimized). The body becomes a problem to be solved rather than a home to inhabit.

Aligning with seasons is one way to push back. It's a statement that biological reality matters. That you're an animal, a sophisticated one, but still subject to rhythms you didn't create and can't fully escape.

## Practical Steps

Start noticing seasonal patterns in your energy, mood, and preferences. Track for a year if you want data.

Adjust sleep schedule seasonally. Even thirty minutes makes a difference.

Shift the balance of activities across the year. More projects and social time in spring/summer, more rest and reflection in fall/winter.

Get outside in natural light, especially mornings. Even brief exposure helps calibrate circadian rhythm.

Reduce artificial light at night, particularly in winter when the contrast matters most.

Plan demanding travel, launches, or initiatives for higher-energy months when possible.

## Not Nostalgia

People dismiss seasonal living as nostalgia because it invokes a pre-industrial pattern. But the argument isn't "old ways are better." The argument is that biology doesn't change as fast as technology, and fighting biology has costs.

You don't have to romanticize the past to recognize that electric light doesn't eliminate photosensitive hormones. That climate control doesn't deactivate circadian genes. That expecting identical performance in December and June ignores how human bodies actually work.

Seasonal living isn't going backward. It's taking what we've learned about chronobiology and actually applying it. It's being smart about the meat vehicle you inhabit.

Your ancestors didn't have a choice; they lived seasonally because the environment forced them to. You have a choice. And for once, the smart choice and the pleasant choice are the same: work with the seasons instead of pretending they don't exist.

Your body already knows what to do. The question is whether you'll listen.
