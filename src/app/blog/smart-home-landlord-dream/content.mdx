## The Amenity That Watches You

Your landlord knows what time you come home. They know when you leave. They know how warm you keep your apartment and whether you had guests last weekend. They know this because you live in a "smart apartment" and every device in it reports to someone who isn't you.

This isn't a dystopian hypothetical. It's a Tuesday in 2026. Smart locks, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart leak sensors: these are marketed to renters as premium amenities, lifestyle upgrades, the future of living. What they actually are is a surveillance infrastructure that tenants didn't ask for, can't opt out of, and frequently don't control.

The question nobody asks during the apartment tour: who has the admin password?

## The Landlord's Dashboard

Companies like SmartRent, which went public in 2021, sell property management platforms that give landlords real-time access to data from every connected device in their buildings. The pitch to property owners is explicit: reduce costs, increase efficiency, monitor units remotely.

SmartRent's platform lets managers control smart locks, thermostats, and sensors across entire portfolios. They can see which units are occupied. They can adjust temperature remotely, ostensibly for energy savings when units are vacant, but the capability doesn't vanish when someone's home. They can grant and revoke access. They can see entry logs.

This is not hidden. It's the selling point. SmartRent's own marketing materials to property managers emphasize "operational efficiency" and "asset protection." When your landlord installs a smart lock, they're not doing you a favor. They're installing a management tool that happens to also open your door.

Aaron Sankin and his colleagues at The Markup have reported extensively on how smart-home technology in rental properties creates an asymmetric power relationship. Tenants get convenience: keyless entry, app-controlled thermostats. Landlords get data, access, and control. The exchange is unequal, and the terms are rarely disclosed.

## The Legal Void

Here's where it gets genuinely concerning. Tenant privacy law in the US was written for a world of physical keys and paper leases. The legal frameworks governing what a landlord can monitor, when they can enter, and what data they can collect were designed before any of this technology existed.

Most states require landlords to give 24 or 48 hours notice before entering a unit. But what counts as "entry" when your landlord can see your thermostat data, your door lock logs, and your motion sensor activity without ever stepping inside? The FTC has raised concerns about IoT devices in rental housing, but regulatory action has been glacial.

Some landlords have installed smart devices that tenants cannot remove or disable because they're wired into the building's infrastructure. Your smart thermostat isn't yours. It's a building system. You live with it or you don't live here.

There have been documented cases of landlords using smart lock access to lock out tenants during disputes, a digital eviction that bypasses the legal process entirely. Change the code and suddenly the tenant can't get in. Good luck explaining to a judge that your landlord locked you out using an app.

## Ring and the Surveillance Corridor

Ring doorbells deserve their own section because they represent something particularly insidious: tenant-facing surveillance marketed as tenant safety.

When your building installs Ring cameras, the footage doesn't belong to you. It belongs to Ring, which is to say, it belongs to Amazon. Amazon's agreements with law enforcement agencies have been well-documented. Ring has shared footage with police without warrants. The doorbell you pass every day on your way to your apartment is a camera that feeds into a surveillance network you never consented to join.

For renters, the calculus is different than for homeowners. A homeowner who buys a Ring camera makes a choice about their own privacy. A renter who lives in a building with Ring cameras makes no choice at all. The camera was there before they signed the lease. It'll be there after they leave. Their comings and goings are recorded regardless of their preferences.

And here's the thing about surveillance: it changes behavior. Studies in behavioral psychology have consistently shown that people act differently when they know they're being watched, the *panopticon effect*, named after Bentham's prison design. You don't have to do anything wrong for constant monitoring to alter how you live. You just have to know it's there.

## You Don't Own Any of This

The smart home problem extends beyond landlords. It touches something deeper about what ownership means when every device is a client in someone else's server infrastructure.

You don't own your Nest data. Google does. You don't own your Ring footage. Amazon does. You don't own your smart TV viewing habits. The manufacturer does, and they sell that data to brokers who sell it to advertisers who use it to build a profile of you that you'll never see and can't delete.

Your Roomba maps your apartment and sends the floor plan to iRobot's cloud. Your smart speaker records audio and transmits it for processing. Your smart TV uses automatic content recognition to track what you watch, frame by frame, and reports it back to companies like Samba TV, which then sells that data.

This is the business model. The device is the trojan horse. The real product is the continuous stream of behavioral data that flows from your home to corporate servers where it's analyzed, packaged, and monetized. You paid for the privilege of being surveilled. In a rental, you didn't even get to choose.

## The Erosion of Private Space

There's a concept in law called the *reasonable expectation of privacy*. Your home is supposed to be the place where that expectation is strongest. It's why police need a warrant to search your apartment. It's why wiretapping laws exist. The home is, in the legal and cultural imagination, the last refuge of the private self.

Smart devices erode that expectation one data point at a time. No single device is the problem. It's the aggregate. Your lock knows when you're home. Your thermostat knows when you're sleeping. Your speaker knows what you talk about. Your TV knows what you watch. Your doorbell knows who visits. Taken together, these data streams construct a remarkably detailed picture of your daily life, assembled by companies you've never interacted with, stored on servers you can't access, governed by terms of service you didn't read.

For renters, who represent roughly 36% of American households, the situation is worse because they lack even the theoretical agency of choice. A homeowner can decide not to install smart devices. A renter walks into an apartment where the infrastructure is already in place, controlled by the property manager, feeding data to platforms the tenant has no relationship with.

## What Would Protecting Tenants Look Like

Some jurisdictions are starting to catch up. A few cities have introduced ordinances requiring landlords to disclose smart-home monitoring to prospective tenants. Some states are considering legislation that would give tenants the right to disable devices in their units. But the regulatory response is fragmented and slow, far slower than the deployment of the technology.

Real protection would require several things: mandatory disclosure of all data-collecting devices before lease signing, tenant control over devices within their unit, strict limits on landlord access to device data, and a clear legal standard that remote monitoring constitutes a form of entry subject to existing notice requirements.

None of this is technically difficult. It's just unpopular with the property management industry, which has discovered that surveillance is profitable and isn't eager to give it up.

## Home Is Not a Product

The deeper issue is this: we've allowed the home to become a platform. A place that generates data, serves ads, and feeds corporate analytics. The smart-home industry's vision of the future is one where every surface, every appliance, every threshold is a point of data collection and a vector for commercial extraction.

For owners, this is a trade you can theoretically accept or refuse. For renters, it's imposed. And the asymmetry between landlord and tenant (in information, in power, in control) is exactly the kind of asymmetry that smart technology amplifies rather than resolves.

When everything in your home phones home to someone else, home isn't private anymore. It's a fishbowl with a lease agreement. And the fish don't get to choose the glass.
