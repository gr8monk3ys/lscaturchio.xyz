THEN, I saw it in person for their tour at Pantages and man was I wrong about how good it is. Seeing this live is an entirely different thing and must be treated as such.

2025-01-24,Paint Drying,2016,https://boxd.it/8AmU0N,0.5,,"A cinematic triumph that bravely thrusts the boundaries of modern filmmaking into places hitherto unimagined by the simple-minded masses. One cannot help but marvel at its uncompromising dedication to the art of the static shot, its refusal to indulge in anything as tawdry as a plot, character development, or, heaven forbid, dialogue. The film opens with a stark, unyielding close-up on a freshly painted wall, an image so pregnant with existential longing that I found myself questioning every life choice I’d made up until that point. The first hour alone is a testament to patience: each minuscule shift in color saturation is akin to being whispered to by the universe itself. By hour three, I was fully convinced I was witnessing the slow and torturous evolution of humanity (or perhaps the slow and torturous evaporation of my sanity, both interpretations are equally valid, of course). In an era where lesser directors pollute their scenes with trifling details like human interaction and conflict, this film offers something infinitely more profound: the paint’s heroic journey from glossy liquidity to matte finality. The castconsisting solely of molecular droplets creeping down a plaster canvasdemonstrates an unparalleled commitment to realism. Their refusal to move with any discernible haste underscores the quiet, meditative brilliance at work. One can practically hear the bold statement: “This is cinema, if you dare to stay awake.” Particularly noteworthy is the film’s culminating scene around hour nine, where the paint appears to have dried almost entirely, save for a faint glimmer of moisture near the baseboard. It’s a moment of searing dramatic tension will that last fleck of dampness surrender to the implacable march of time, or will it cling stubbornly to the ephemeral riddle of existence? I was riveted. To dismiss this masterpiece as a monotonous exercise in tedium would be to miss its higher calling: a labyrinth of metaphors for the slow decay of modern society, the paradox of creation and destruction, and perhaps a witty commentary on our unrelenting quest for instant gratification. After all, is this not the ultimate challenge for the viewer’s stamina, perseverance, and sense of self-worth? In short, only the truly enlightened will appreciate the audacious novelty of gazing upon a wall as its surface transitions from wet to dry over a glorious 600 minute symphony of inaction. For those incapable of comprehending its subtle genius, I can only offer my deepest sympathies. As for me, I left the screening feeling cultured, awakened, and maybe just a little bit better than everyone else.",,2017-01-01

2025-08-27,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean,2021,https://boxd.it/aSvawJ,3,,Frankly not the best part in the franchise. I do appreciate the ending however and what that is supposed to allude to for the next three parts. I think Jolyne as a Jojo just doesn't live up to the other ones as much.

Many have been lead to believe that there is exaggeration about the fires but from acquaintances that have been directly affected, it wasn't in the slightest. Although there are portions of it that are such as the robbing scene (to the extent that it was shown) that definitely were exaggerated as well as a missing teacher that was in the bus due to not wanting to be represented in the movie, overall the expressed sympathy for the families and for the daring efforts of all involved is a stark reminder of hope after such atrocious events.",,2025-10-19

Upon researching what ""Bugonia"" means I was left with the concept of bees coming out spontaneously out of cows. I thought to myself, well that is a re-occurring theme throughout but it must be about how we could be left to rabbit holes that warp our very understanding of the world. Turns out the message was not that because that was far too obvious but instead the former idea which I had previously mentioned. Why is that the case? Because of the satisfying ending.",,2025-10-24

When it comes to cinematography, acting, plot, the slimy intro. I found myself not fully attached to this type of character and seems all too familiar. Not sure if the hunger and drive of a character ultimately ruining their relationship with everyone else is a recurring theme for Safdie but I just felt like he already had done that with Uncut Gems. Suffice to say, the absolute best part of the movie was the story of the bee hive honey being hidden for all to share because to me it seemed as though such a great ping pong player had gone through such selflessness as a antithesis to Marty himself who gets himself in for lack of a better term deep ass shit.",,2025-12-23
