## Beyond the Stereotypes

Drive through rural America and you'll see red signs. Flags. Bumper stickers announcing political allegiances. The message seems clear: this is conservative country, monolithically right-wing, culturally alien to urban progressives.

This perception is wrong. Not entirely wrong — rural areas do vote heavily Republican in national elections — but wrong in ways that matter enormously for understanding American politics and geography.

Rural America isn't a monolith. It's a mosaic. And the stories we tell about it say more about urban assumptions than rural realities.

## The Abandonment

Before talking about rural politics, we need to talk about rural economics. Because the political story can't be understood without the economic one.

Rural America has been systematically abandoned for decades.

Hospitals have closed. Schools have consolidated. Banks have shuttered branches. Grocery stores have disappeared. The infrastructure of everyday life — the institutions that make a place livable — has been steadily stripped away.

This isn't natural decline. It's the result of policy choices. Agricultural consolidation (encouraged by federal policy) destroyed family farms and the communities they supported. Trade agreements shipped manufacturing jobs overseas. Deregulation allowed corporations to abandon unprofitable markets — which means rural ones.

The people who stayed watched their towns hollow out. They watched young people leave for cities where jobs existed. They watched Main Streets empty and institutions crumble.

And then politicians showed up every four years to ask for their votes.

## The Political Complexity

Here's what the urban-rural political narrative misses: rural politics is far more complicated than national voting patterns suggest.

Yes, rural areas vote Republican in presidential elections. But look closer. Look at state and local races. Look at ballot initiatives. Look at what actually happens in rural communities, rather than how they vote in national contests.

You'll find surprising things.

Rural voters consistently support minimum wage increases — even in deep-red states. They support expanded Medicaid. They support investments in infrastructure and broadband. On economic issues, rural Americans are often to the left of the Democratic Party establishment.

The rightward shift in rural voting is relatively recent. Many rural areas — particularly in the Midwest and Plains — were strongholds of progressive populism within living memory. These places produced the movements that broke up monopolies, established worker protections, and created the social safety net.

That history didn't disappear. It went dormant.

## What Rural Actually Means

The category "rural" obscures more than it reveals. Rural Maine isn't rural Texas isn't rural Oregon isn't rural Alabama. These places have different histories, different economies, different cultures, different demographics.

Some rural areas are predominantly white. Others have significant Black, Latino, or Indigenous populations. Some depend on agriculture. Others on extraction — logging, mining, drilling. Others on tourism. Others on nothing much at all anymore.

The politics of these places differ dramatically. Rural areas with strong union histories vote differently than those without. Rural areas with diverse populations vote differently than homogeneous ones. Rural areas near metropolitan regions vote differently than truly isolated communities.

Treating "rural" as a single political category is like treating "urban" as one. It flattens essential distinctions.

## The Organizing

Something is happening in rural America that gets almost no media coverage: people are organizing.

Worker cooperatives are forming. Community land trusts are acquiring property. Mutual aid networks are filling gaps left by departed institutions. Local food systems are emerging. Broadband cooperatives are building infrastructure that telecommunications companies refused to provide.

This organizing is often explicitly political, but not always in partisan terms. It's about building power and capacity at the local level. It's about taking control of resources and institutions that have been extracted or abandoned.

Some of this organizing is leftist in orientation — influenced by cooperative economics, ecological thinking, Indigenous practices. Some is libertarian — focused on local autonomy and independence from distant authorities. Much of it defies easy categorization.

What it shares is a rejection of the narrative that rural places are doomed to decline. And a determination to build alternatives to systems that have failed them.

## The Urban Gaze

Urban progressives have a rural problem. They don't understand rural America — and worse, they don't think they need to.

The dominant urban narrative frames rural people as backward, bigoted, voting against their own interests. This narrative is condescending, inaccurate, and politically counterproductive.

It's condescending because it assumes urban perspectives are naturally correct and rural ones are deviations requiring explanation. It's inaccurate because it mistakes voting patterns for political views and treats cultural differences as moral failures. It's counterproductive because it alienates potential allies and reinforces the urban-rural divide that serves conservative interests.

Rural people know they're being looked down on. They can feel the contempt radiating from metropolitan media and political establishments. This doesn't make them conservative — but it does make them hostile to institutions and parties that seem to despise them.

Building genuine political solidarity across the urban-rural divide requires actually respecting rural people and their concerns. Not performing respect. Actually having it.

## The Land Question

Underneath rural politics lies a fundamental question: who controls the land?

Rural areas contain most of America's natural resources, agricultural production, and ecological systems. They're where the food comes from, where the water comes from, where the energy comes from. They're also where the extraction happens — where the costs of industrial civilization get externalized.

But rural people increasingly don't control what happens to their land. Absentee owners — corporations, investment funds, distant landlords — own more and more of rural America. Decisions about land use get made in distant boardrooms based on financial calculations that have nothing to do with community wellbeing.

This is a recipe for resentment. And it's a potential basis for cross-ideological organizing. Left and right can disagree about many things while agreeing that communities should have meaningful control over the places they live.

## Beyond the Binary

The urban-rural divide is real but overstated. And the political categories applied to it — liberal versus conservative, blue versus red — obscure more than they illuminate.

Rural America contains multitudes. It contains deep conservatism and radical organizing. It contains xenophobia and immigrant communities building new lives. It contains extraction industries and ecological restoration. It contains despair and determination.

The story of rural America isn't settled. The political future isn't written. What happens depends on whether rural communities can build power and whether urban allies can see them as partners rather than problems.

Rural America isn't what you think. And understanding what it actually is — in all its complexity and contradiction — matters for anyone who wants to understand American politics, American geography, or American futures.

The countryside isn't going anywhere. The question is what it becomes.
