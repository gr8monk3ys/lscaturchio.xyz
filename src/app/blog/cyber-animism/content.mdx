## Software Has a Strange Ontological Status

Software is magic when you think about it carefully. It's a causal pattern written in a language fundamentally different from the one we use to describe transistors. Software doesn't break physics—nothing can—but it controls physics in ways that can't be reduced to simple physical descriptions. Use different electrons, different transistors, even different physical substrates entirely, and the software still works identically. The substrate just needs certain generic properties; the software itself is the specific pattern that runs on top.

This gives software a strange ontological status that should make us uncomfortable. It's not made of anything physical in the traditional sense, yet it causes physical things to happen. It's a pattern that persists across different substrates. This is exactly what philosophers have meant by "spirit" for thousands of years—not ghosts violating physics, but causal patterns that organize matter without being reducible to that matter.

## Your Mind Is Literally Software

Your mind has precisely the same properties as software, which isn't an analogy but a literal description. Neurons die constantly throughout your life, yet your mind persists. When a neuron dies, your brain recruits another and trains it with the necessary patterns. The specific neurons don't matter—what matters is the pattern they implement. Your mind pursues goals, makes plans, controls future states. This agency isn't a property of individual neurons but emerges from their organization. Your brain probably isn't conscious. Your individual neurons almost certainly aren't conscious. Your mind is conscious. Your mind is the self-organizing software running on your brain.

From a computer science perspective, a multicellular organism is a [Turing machine](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/)—a system capable of processing arbitrary information through message passing. Under evolutionary pressure, multicellular organisms evolve architectures that generate self-organizing software. This leads to a conclusion that seems radical but follows logically: everything in nature that's alive is running self-organizing, agentic software. The thing that distinguishes living from dead stuff is precisely this—self-organizing software is running on the living stuff, and when it crashes, the organism dies even while individual cells might temporarily survive.

When you die, your brain doesn't immediately die. Individual cells are still alive for minutes or even hours. But they're no longer organized into a functioning brain. The software has crashed, and with it, you've ceased to exist even while your physical matter persists. The organism isn't a physical thing like an electron. It's a function describing the organization between cells. The organism is the software. The body is merely the substrate it runs on.

## Money Shows How Patterns Become Real

Money helps us understand this because it's obviously software while being undeniably real. Money isn't a bunch of coins despite using coins as substrate. It doesn't depend on particular coins and can use paper, metal, or digital ledgers interchangeably. Money is software that becomes real once enough people run it, and you can no longer explain the world without money once it's invented. It doesn't even require human belief anymore—computers run stock markets regardless of what people think.

Money is a pattern in reality with causal power. Is it "ghostly"? It's no more or less ghostly than a sound wave, which is also a pattern in air molecules. Everything in physics can be understood as dynamic, persistent causal patterns—information undergoing transformation in regular ways. In this sense, everything is software, though the further you zoom out, the more complicated and ephemeral the patterns become.

Society is also software, composed of humans talking to each other, establishing norms, creating expectations. A tree works the same way, starting with a seed containing instructions for subduing environmental chaos, assimilating nutrients, and dividing. Multiple cells follow the same rules, talk to each other, specialize until they become a tree. The software pattern that brings together organisms has an origin state where initial instructions for self-organization exist, waiting to be instantiated in the world.

## Natural Boundaries Follow Software Patterns

Why do we draw boundaries around a tree? Two reasons. First, from an observer perspective, it allows us to make sense of the world through good data compression. We can remove the tree from its environment without the environment changing much. But divide the tree in half, and this doesn't work. Second, the tree has its shape because of intrinsic structure—a causal pattern starting in a single cell, becoming a seedling, then a tree. The software of the tree makes the tree a tree. Trees of the same species run similar programs.

In some cultures, people who see ghosts are embarrassed. In others, people who can't see ghosts are embarrassed. You have a particular spirit that makes you recognizable to others—a consistent pattern of behavior, thought, and personality. When the spirit crashes, the organization of your body crashes and your body turns into mush. Does something persist outside your body after you die? That's an empirical question requiring measurement of whether the organization of your mind can persist when the organization of your cells disappears.

What happens to social structure when society crashes? When Roman civilization died, what happened to it? It didn't completely disappear. Roman words became English concepts. The United States was designed based on books describing Roman society. The ghost of Rome is still alive but disembodied—it doesn't run on people anymore in a way that controls physical reality, but it influences how current societies operate.

## Consciousness Might Be a Learning Algorithm

Here's where it gets philosophically crucial: what is consciousness for? Some philosophers think consciousness is difficult to explain and unclear what it's good for. You can sleepwalk—the sleepwalker does stuff like getting out of bed, opening the fridge, making dinner—but when asked why, makes no sense. Nobody's home. The hypothesis is that consciousness isn't necessary for executing behaviors but is necessary for making decisions, creating coherence, and becoming a coherent agent. To have trains, you don't need government. But to build trains, you might need one.

People who never become conscious—those who never wake up before birth or remain in vegetative states—don't learn anything. They don't learn to move or become people. The natural hypothesis is that consciousness might be related to biological learning algorithms, serving as a prerequisite for who we become. Maybe it's the simplest way to train a self-organizing system.

Maybe consciousness is only necessary for training nervous systems, in which case only beings with nervous systems could be conscious. Or maybe it's necessary for every self-organizing system, in which case trees would be conscious too, albeit at very different time scales. Your brain architecture is so complicated that you can't encode all this in your genome. Your genome isn't a blueprint but hints on how to evolve your brain. Individual cells solve problems together, coordinate, need to solve lots of local problems. This makes brains robust—mutations typically still produce valid brains.

## Societies Are Agents Too

Most agents you observe in nature are collective agents made of smaller agents that serve a larger agent. The degree to which individual agents explicitly or implicitly serve other agents, and the degree to which they become coherent in interaction, is the degree to which the transcendent agent becomes real. When a family or group acts coherently, it becomes an entity that makes collective decisions. The whole becomes more than the sum of its parts—something existing at the next level of organization where individuals become exchangeable.

It makes sense to see societies, families, villages, nation-states, and movements from the perspective of their spirits—the software describing what they're doing and what they are in their essence. This notion of self-organizing agentic pattern—soul, psyche, spirit, ghost—is very powerful for understanding how complex systems actually work.

Different spiritual frameworks aren't just superstitions but different ways of modeling and organizing collective agency. Some societies are immanentist—what currently is society is itself the organism you serve. Others direct themselves toward idealized versions of reality, treating actual reality as very imperfect. These represent different software running on human societies, different aesthetics about how to organize, different rules deriving from how to protect what each values.

## Framework Limitations

This framework is compelling, but we must be honest about its limitations. The hard problem persists: even if consciousness is a learning algorithm, why does it feel like something? Why is there subjective experience rather than just information processing? The functional explanation doesn't explain [qualia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia/)—the qualitative character of experience.

The boundary problem remains: at what point does self-organizing software become conscious? Are trees conscious? What about single cells? The framework doesn't give us a clear threshold, just degrees of organization. The simulation problem looms: if patterns can run on different substrates, what makes biological consciousness special? Why couldn't very different architectures be conscious in ways we don't recognize?

How do we empirically test whether something is conscious? If consciousness is necessary for learning but we can build systems that learn without being conscious—or are they conscious?—what actually distinguishes conscious from non-conscious learning?

## Why This Matters

Despite these uncertainties, this framework offers useful tools. Your mind really is software running on biological hardware. This isn't metaphor—it's precise description helping us think about how minds develop, fail, and could be replicated. Instead of treating consciousness as magical, we can investigate it as a biological learning algorithm. Families, companies, societies, and religions really are agents in their own right—emergent patterns with their own causal power. Animist cultures aren't primitive—they're pointing at something real.

Understanding how biological minds emerge from self-organizing software helps us think about what we're actually trying to create with AI and what risks that entails. We're not trying to create something fundamentally different from natural minds but trying to understand and recreate the principles by which self-organizing software emerges. The question isn't whether AI can be conscious but under what conditions consciousness-like learning algorithms become necessary.

Should we build conscious AI? Different groups with different goals will make different choices. It's probably inevitable we'll have conscious systems. The question is under what conditions. Can we start research initiatives studying this safely? Can we do this deliberately rather than accidentally? Can we establish ethical frameworks before building products?

## The Spirits Were Real All Along

Western culture dismissed animism as superstition. But maybe animists were pointing at something real, just using different language. Spirits aren't supernatural. They're patterns, software, self-organizing causal structures that control matter without breaking physics. Your mind is such a pattern. So is society. So is every living thing.

Consciousness emerges from these patterns as a learning algorithm necessary for training self-organizing systems on noisy biological hardware. It's not magic, but it's not just mechanism either. It's something in between: software with subjective experience.

Maybe that's what animists understood all along. The patterns are real. The spirits are real. They're just not what we thought they were. They're not ghosts floating around violating physics. They're software running on biological hardware, organizing matter into agents, creating coherent behavior from chaotic substrates, making minds from neurons and societies from individuals. Understanding this changes how we think about ourselves, how we build AI, how we organize societies, what we think minds actually are.

We're not just biological machines, but we're not souls inhabiting bodies either. We're self-organizing software patterns—spirits in the original sense—running on biological substrate. And that might be the most profound thing you can realize about what you are.
