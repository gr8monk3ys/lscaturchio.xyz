          Last updated: February 4, 2025
        </p>
        
        <h2>Transparency Statement</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in being transparent about how I operate and handle data. This page outlines my practices
          and gives you insight into how I maintain sustainability while providing value to the community.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          I use Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights to understand website performance and user experience.
          These tools are privacy-focused and do not collect personally identifiable information. The analytics
          help me improve the website&apos;s performance and content quality.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
          I collect minimal information, only what&apos;s necessary to provide my services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact form submissions (name, email, message)</li>
          <li>Consultation bookings through Calendly</li>
          <li>Project-related communications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>
          All data is stored securely using modern encryption standards. I use:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vercel for website hosting and deployment</li>
          <li>Secure email servers for communications</li>
          <li>Industry-standard security practices for all stored data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          I use several third-party services to enhance functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vercel - Website hosting and analytics</li>
          <li>Calendly - Consultation scheduling</li>
          <li>GitHub - Code repository and version control</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each service has its own privacy policy, and I encourage you to review them.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>
          This website is open source, and you can verify how your data is handled by reviewing the code on
          my GitHub repository. I believe in transparency through code.
        </p>

        <h2>Sustainability Practices</h2>
        <p>
          I strive to make my digital services environmentally conscious by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimizing website performance to reduce server load</li>
          <li>Using efficient code practices</li>
          <li>Choosing eco-friendly hosting providers</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
