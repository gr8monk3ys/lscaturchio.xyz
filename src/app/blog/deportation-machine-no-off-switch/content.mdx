## The Problem With Building Machines

Here's something nobody wants to admit: once you build a deportation apparatus, you can't just turn it off when it becomes politically inconvenient. The machine doesn't have an off switch. It has budgets, personnel, institutional momentum, and — most importantly — it has quotas to hit.

You build the infrastructure to deport "the bad ones." Fine. Noble cause, right? Get rid of criminals. Keep communities safe. But here's the thing about enforcement bureaucracies: they're measured by throughput. By numbers. By how many people they process.

And when you run out of "bad ones"? The machine doesn't just shut down and send everyone home.

## Mission Creep Isn't a Bug

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency employs tens of thousands of people. They have an annual budget measured in billions. Detention centers — many of them private, profit-driven — need to maintain occupancy rates to justify their contracts.

What happens when an organization built to find and remove people runs low on obviously deportable targets?

They expand the definition. They broaden the net. They find new categories of people who technically qualify under increasingly creative interpretations of the law. This isn't conspiracy theory stuff — it's just how institutions work. They justify their existence by doing the thing they were built to do, regardless of whether that thing still needs doing at the same scale.

The deportation machine started with a promise: we're only going after dangerous criminals. Gang members. Threats to public safety. But the infrastructure doesn't care about promises. It cares about capacity utilization.

## The Ratchet Only Turns One Way

Here's where it gets predictable. Every expansion of enforcement powers gets sold as temporary. As targeted. As surgical. Just this one group. Just for now. Just until we solve the problem.

But bureaucratic powers rarely contract voluntarily. The hiring doesn't reverse. The detention centers don't close (especially not the private ones with contractual minimum occupancy requirements). The surveillance systems don't get dismantled.

Instead, each expansion becomes the new baseline. The floor, not the ceiling.

And the next administration — regardless of party — inherits a bigger, more sophisticated, more automated deportation apparatus than the previous one left. They might use it differently. They might target different groups. But the machine itself? It's already there, humming along, waiting to be deployed.

## Numbers Over People

The shift from targeting to quota-hitting happens gradually, then suddenly. At first, ICE agents focus on people with serious criminal records. Makes sense. Easy to defend. But there's a problem: there aren't enough of them to keep the machine running at capacity.

So the criteria expand. Minor offenses count. Traffic violations. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Eventually, any undocumented person becomes a valid target — not because policy explicitly changed, but because the institution needs to hit its numbers.

This is what happens when you industrialize enforcement. The human element disappears. Discretion evaporates. The system optimizes for efficiency, not justice.

You end up with farmworkers getting picked up during traffic stops. Parents detained while dropping kids at school. People who've lived in the country for decades suddenly swept up because the algorithm flagged them and the agent needs to meet quota.

Is this the system working as intended? Depends on what you think the intention was.

## The Private Prison Problem

Let's talk about the elephant in the detention center: profit motive. Private prison companies don't make money from empty beds. They have contracts with guaranteed minimums — literal requirements to keep facilities at certain occupancy levels or face financial penalties.

So you've got an enforcement agency that needs to justify its budget by producing deportations, working in tandem with private contractors that need to maintain detention rates to stay profitable. The incentives align perfectly — just not in favor of actually solving immigration issues or treating human beings with dignity.

The machine feeds itself. More detentions mean more justification for larger budgets. Larger budgets mean more capacity. More capacity means pressure to fill beds. And round and round it goes.

Nobody had to consciously decide "let's make the system crueler." The institutional logic took care of that automatically.

## Automation Makes It Worse

Technology should make things more precise, right? More targeted? More careful?

Yeah, that's not what happens. Automation in deportation enforcement means facial recognition at borders, license plate readers in immigrant neighborhoods, data-sharing agreements between local police and federal immigration authorities, algorithms that flag people based on risk scores nobody fully understands.

What it doesn't mean is more careful consideration of individual cases. More humanity. More discretion. It means the opposite: faster processing, higher throughput, fewer bottlenecks. The machine gets more efficient at being a machine.

And here's the kicker — once these systems are deployed, they stick around. The databases don't get deleted. The surveillance infrastructure doesn't get dismantled. Future administrations inherit not just the legal authority to deport, but the technological capacity to do it at scale.

## The Liberal's Dilemma

This is where a certain kind of political analysis falls apart. You can't support building the deportation machine under the assumption that only responsible people will use it. That's not how power works.

Build the infrastructure, and someone will use it. Maybe not today. Maybe not this election cycle. But eventually, someone less concerned with procedural niceties will take the controls. And they'll find that all the hard work — the legal frameworks, the detention centers, the surveillance systems — has already been done for them.

The Obama administration deported more people than any previous president. Set records. Built capacity. Expanded the machine. The justification was that they were being "smart" about it, targeting the right people. Setting priorities.

Then the next administration inherited that expanded capacity and said, "Thanks for the upgrade."

This isn't about individual politicians making bad decisions. It's about institutional logic. The machine, once built, develops its own imperatives. Its own momentum. Its own constituency of people whose jobs and budgets depend on its continued operation.

## What Reform Can't Fix

You can't reform the deportation machine into something humane. You can tweak policies. Change enforcement priorities. Issue memos about discretion. But the fundamental infrastructure remains: the agents, the detention centers, the quotas, the profit motives, the surveillance systems.

As long as the machine exists, it will be used. As long as it's used, it will expand. As long as it expands, more people will get caught in its gears — people who were never supposed to be targets in the first place.

That's not a failure of the system. That's the system working exactly as systems like this inevitably work: by growing, by finding new targets, by justifying their own existence through increased activity.

## The Only Off Switch

So what's the solution? If the machine can't be reformed, can't be trusted to stay within its original bounds, can't be expected to shrink voluntarily — what then?

The uncomfortable answer: you don't fix it. You dismantle it. You don't try to make mass deportation more humane or targeted or efficient. You stop doing mass deportation.

But that requires admitting that the entire apparatus — not just its excesses, but its core function — is the problem. And that's a harder conversation than most people are ready to have.

Until then, the machine keeps running. Expanding. Finding new targets. Doing what machines do.

Because machines don't have off switches. They have capacity. And capacity demands to be used.
